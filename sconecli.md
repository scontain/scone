# SCONE CLI

You can run the [`scone` CLI](https://sconedocs.github.io/CAS_cli/) on your **host machine**, within a **virtual machine (VM)**, or inside a **container**. While running it in a container offers good portability, it may suffer from slower startup times. Therefore, we recommend installing the `scone` CLI **directly on your development machine** for better performance.

This document explains how to install the `scone` CLI on **Linux distributions that support Debian packages**. Packages are also available for **Alpine Linux**.

## Caveat When Running Inside a Container

There are two versions of the `scone` CLI:

- A **native version** that cannot run inside an enclave
- The **default version**, which is designed to run **inside an enclave**
  
By default, the `scone` CLI of a container runs confidential in production mode. To run in simulation mode on systems that do not support production TEEs, set the environment variable `SCONE_PRODUCTION=0`, e.g., you can run`SCONE_PRODUCTION=0 scone --help` .

Below, we describe how to install the `scone` CLI using `auto` mode, i.e., the CLI will most likely run in simulation mode.

## Installing the `scone` CLI 

We assume in this description that you run a Debian-based distribution like Ubuntu. Note that we also have packages for Alpine Linux.

```bash
# determine the latest stable version of SCONE:
VERSION=$(curl -L -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scontain/scone/refs/heads/main/stable.txt)
echo "The lastest stable version of SCONE is $VERSION"
```

The SCONE CLI is available as Debian packages as part of a container image. 
We first verify that the container image is properly signed by cosign.

To do so, we define the cosign public verification key using a function `create_cosign_verification_key`.
We verify the signature of a given container image with function `verify_image`:

```bash
#
# create a file with the public key of the signer key for all scone.cloud images
#

function create_cosign_verification_key() {
    export cosign_public_key_file="$(mktemp).pub"
    cat > $cosign_public_key_file <<EOF
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAErLf0HT8xZlLaoX5jNN8aVL1Yrs+P
wS7K6tXeRlWLlUX1GeEtTdcuhZMKb5VUNaWEJW2ZU0YIF91D93dCZbUYpw==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
EOF
}

function verify_image() {
    local image_name
    image_name="$1"
    if [[ "$image_name" == "" ]]; then
        echo "The name of the image for which we should verify the signature, was empty. Exiting."
        exit 1
    fi

    echo "Verifying the signature of image '$image_name'"

    docker pull "$image_name" >/dev/null
    export cosign_public_key_file=${cosign_public_key_file:-""}
    if [[ "$cosign_public_key_file" == "" ]]; then
        create_cosign_verification_key
    fi
    cosign verify --key "$cosign_public_key_file" "$image_name" >/dev/null 2> /dev/null || { echo "Failed to verify signature of image '$image_name'! Exiting! Please check that 'cosign version' shows a git version >= 2.0.0. Also ensure that there is no field 'credsStore' in '$HOME/.docker/config.json'"; exit 1; }

    echo " - verification was successful"
}
```

Next, we define the image that contains the `scone` CLI Debian package and
verify the image:

```bash
# default repo and image name
export REPO="registry.scontain.com/scone.cloud"
export IMAGE="scone-deb-pkgs"

verify_image "$REPO/$IMAGE:$VERSION"
```

After successful verification, we create a temporary container
to be able to copy the Debian packages to the local filesystem.

```bash
# run container such that we can copy the packages to a local repo
docker create --name scone-packages "$REPO/$IMAGE:$VERSION" sleep 1 > /dev/null
```

Next, we copy the package to the `/tmp` directory and
install the `scone` packages. 

You need to type your `sudo` password:

```bash
# copy the packages
mkdir -p /tmp/packages
docker cp scone-packages:/packages /tmp/
docker rm scone-packages

# install the packages
sudo dpkg -i \
     /tmp/packages/scone-common_amd64.deb \
     /tmp/packages/scone-libc_amd64.deb \
     /tmp/packages/scone-cli_amd64.deb \
     /tmp/packages/kubectl-scone.deb \
     /tmp/packages/k8s-scone.deb

# clean up
rm -rf /tmp/packages
```

We ensure that `kubectl-scone` plugin only exists once - otherwise, `kubectl` issues a warning:

```bash
if [[ -e /usr/bin/kubectl-scone && -e /bin/kubectl-scone ]] ; then
    sudo rm -f /usr/bin/kubectl-scone
fi
```

Check that the `scone` cli is properly installed by executing:

```bash
echo "Expecting SCONE version: $VERSION"
scone --version
```

This should execute the same SCONE version as the previously printed latest stable version.
(The minimal version is 5.10.0-rc.5)

```bash
  echo "âœ… All scone-related executable installed"
```
